            <ul id="list of calvin johnsson accomplishments">
                <li><strong>His 11,619 yards and 83 touchdowns are the most in NFL history for a player with no playoff
                        wins.</strong>- Yes, it’s true. Calvin Johnson never won a playoff game. He only made the
                    postseason twice. But the team’s failures weren’t his fault: Johnson consistently put up eye-popping
                    numbers despite not having a dynamic No. 2 receiver to take away coverage until Golden Tate came to
                    town. </li>
                <li><strong>He leads all players in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns and 100-yard games since
                        coming into the league in 2007. </strong>- It’s hard to argue that Johnson wasn’t the best
                    receiver in the NFL when he was on the field. Those numbers prove exactly that as he was second to
                    none since he was drafted second overall in 2007.</li>
                <li><strong>Johnson is one of five wide receivers to be taken in the top-two picks all-time.</strong>-
                    Only four other receivers have ever been taken either first or second overall in NFL history:
                    Charles Rogers (2003), Keyshawn Johnson (1996), Irving Fryar (1984) and Lam Jones (1980). Johnson
                    trails only Fryar on that list in receiving yards and touchdowns.</li>
                <li><strong>His 86.1 yards per game are No. 1 in NFL history among players who have played at least 100
                        games. </strong>- The only player in NFL history to average more receiving yards per game is
                    Julio Jones (95.4). Jones has played 65 games in his career, so in about three seasons, Jones could
                    potentially unseat Johnson at the top. </li>
                <li><strong> He holds the record for the most receiving yards (1,964) in a single season in NFL
                        history.</strong>- Who could forget the incredible season Johnson put together in 2012? He was
                    just 36 yards shy of being the first player ever to record 2,000 receiving yards as he posted
                    arguably the best season by a wideout ever. He was essentially unguardable.</li>
